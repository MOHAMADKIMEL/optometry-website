Regular eye exams are an essential part of maintaining overall eye health, even if you donâ€™t wear glasses or contact lenses. Many eye conditions, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, often develop silently without noticeable symptoms until significant damage has occurred.
Routine check-ups help detect these issues early, allowing for timely treatment and preventing long-term vision loss. Eye exams also update prescriptions and check for changes in visual acuity that might be affecting your daily life, including driving, reading, or using digital devices.
Children and adults alike benefit from regular visits to the optometrist. For kids, early detection of vision problems is crucial for learning and development. For adults, especially over 40, monitoring for age-related conditions becomes increasingly important.
Scheduling an eye exam at least once every one to two years is a proactive step toward preserving your eyesight and overall well-being.
