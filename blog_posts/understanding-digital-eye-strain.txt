With so much of our work and leisure time spent on digital devices, digital eye strain—also known as computer vision syndrome—is becoming more common.
Symptoms include dry eyes, headaches, blurred vision, and neck or shoulder pain. These issues result from prolonged screen exposure, poor lighting, incorrect screen positioning, or uncorrected vision problems.
To reduce digital eye strain, practice the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Adjust screen brightness, use anti-glare screens, and ensure proper posture while working.
Blue light glasses may also help reduce eye strain, especially if you spend extended hours in front of screens. It's also important to blink regularly and consider using lubricating eye drops to combat dryness.
Taking small steps can lead to big relief in your daily comfort and long-term eye health.
